# ds_ml_portfolio

In this repository, you can find sample projects I worked on during my journey through Data Science, 
Machine Learning and other interesting fields of Computer Science.

Here are descriptions for the projects you can find within this portfolio:

### ebay_car_sales_exploration
This project was inspired by the course I took on dataquest.io

### iris_001
This is my basic take on the famous "Hello World" of Machine Learning

### Titanic Disaster
In this project, I tackle the kaggle.com competition, trying to predict wether or not a passenger of the ship survived the disaster or not.

### cali_housing
This project was inspired by the book by Aurélion Géron - Hands on Machine Learning.
The goal is to predict the median housing value for a district in the state of california.

### dataviz_tut
In this notebook I follow a tutorial by sentdex (reputable Youtuber, WEBSITE: PYTHONPROGRAMMING.NET)

### RL_PP_net
In this folder, there are python scripts I created while following a tutorial by sentdex on Reinforcement Learning

### census_data_1994 
In this notebook, I am exploring the presented dataset and try following a structured approach for a ML project as found in the project guidelines in HOML.
